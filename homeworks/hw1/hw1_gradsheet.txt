                                For liu14       Liu, Allister


Notes & Comments


38: in giving this error message, also include that you were trying to
open the file FOR WRITING

47: third param to write syscall is not needed unless O_CREAT, but it
is harmless to include it

86: once you detect the first binary character, you could terminate the
for loop

103-ish: partial write detection, no recovery
