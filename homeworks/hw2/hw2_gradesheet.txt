                                        For liu14       Liu, Allister


Notes on Problems 1 and 2

1C: OK, you said "not fragmented" which I will accept to mean the same
thing as "contiguous"

2A: your answer is incomplete.  since there are no hard links to directories,
the count nlink==4 shows that there are two child subdirectories, each
creating a .. link


2B: your answer here and for 2A is very similar to Amy Leong's, or vice-versa,
but you submitted separately.  I would say that you are implying the inode
cache here, which is a factor, but the bigger factor is the dentry cache.


2C i: your answer is just regurgitating the journal entries from the problem
set sheet, without explaining the bigger picture (which is that a new
file is created and then written to)

2c ii: you were confused by the question.  I said "before" we replay the
journal.  You answered what happens after the replay

2c iv: I accept your answer as correct but just to be clear, with data=ordered
or data=writeback, the file data themselves are never written to the
journal.  The distinction is when the change to the inode's size and
data block map is written to the journal vs when the actual data are
written to disk.
